        "description": "The cornerstone of scientific inquiry is selecting a well-defined question. Ask yourself: What do you want to study and why? A strong question can drive understanding, foster innovation, and solve real-world problems. Consider who else might share your interest. Often, a well-crafted question serves as a conceptual model that frames reality in distinct ways.",

You may have to revisit this as you go through this design work. It is ok if it starts out being suboptimal. Just write your best idea of the question you want to work on. Include a brief explanation of why this question matters to you (objectives).\n\nMake a list of scientists who will also care about the question. We recommend starting with about 5 to have a crosssection of the field."

I want you to check if the question feels like a good question for scientific inquiry. I want you to list strengths and weaknesses of this question. I want you to check if the question well matches the expressed reasons for wanting to answer that question, and I want you to make a list of strengths/weaknesses in the match between question and objectives. I want you to evaluate to which level the listed scientists really would find this question interesting, again in terms of pros and cons.

        "description": "A strong scientific question invites at least two plausible explanations or hypotheses, leading to distinct interpretations. It thus has a consequential answer—the result will change how you or others approach the field in the future. A detailed question asks if we should prefer one hypothesis over others, which can be decided by data. Ideally, hypotheses should be expressed in precise terms—whether mathematically or through computational models.\n\nWhen formulating your hypotheses, clarify whether they are novel or have been previously tested, and if the latter, emphasize the importance of replication. And make sure they are fully specified with every word clearly defined. They should specify which exact scenarios they apply to. Finally, verify that you can express your hypotheses as a mathematical model or equation that predicts data probabilities—a key step for robust statistical analysis.",

How can we make sure the hypotheses are cleanly tested? Do you have preliminary data for planning?\n\nSome overarching ideas to generate strong experiments:\n● Sketch how the experiment will convincingly produce the right data.\n● Ensure you are not conducting the experiment simply because it is feasible in your lab.\n● If possible, simulate experiments first.\n● Ask yourself which other questions can be answered with the dataset.\n\nThere are many methods that might inadvertently favor a preferred hypothesis. Rigorous experimental design uses practices that minimize the risk of self-deception.\n● If you deal with human evaluations, understand the need for blinding, lest you see what you want.\n● If you use resources, know how to validate. Otherwise you can not replicate\n● If you ask mechanistic questions, you likely need to perturb, consider potential confounders.\n● Ensure you are asking the question in the most direct way possible. Indirect answers are unreliable.\n● If performing perturbations to test causality, randomize them or you will be biased.\n● Ensure all aspects of the study are reproducible, by making sure you report everything.\n● If you use instruments, make sure they are calibrated and validated.\n● Have some diversity of analysed samples to be able to speak to internal validity and think through external validity.\n● Make sure you have the ethical side, ACUC and IRB covered.",

How can we know how uncertain we are? How can we make sure we are not fooling ourselves in the data analysis?\n\nSome Ideas to generate strong data analysis plans\n● Consider validating your analysis approach on simulated or pilot data to ensure reliability.\n● Write down what you extract from the data and how each hypothesis expects different extractions.\n● Implement hypotheses mathematically so they assign compatibility between hypothesis and data (taking care of free parameters).\n● Pre-register your data analysis plan and maintain a detailed log of any deviations from the original protocol to ensure complete transparency and minimize bias.\n\nAVOID THE DATA ANALYSIS RIGOR TRAPS\nThere are so many ways how we our data analysis pipeline can favor a hypothesis we like. The key about doing rigorous data analysis is to use practices that minimize the probability of misleading ourselves.\n● Use the most direct data analysis strategy to answer your question to avoid misleading answers.\n● Know what outcome switching is and have a plan to avoid it.\n● Be aware statistical power and plan your study large enough.\n● Be aware of human biases (such as conflict of interest) and have a plan to avoid them.\n● Store and handle data in a replicable and shareable manner.\n● Use a good quantification metric (one that approximates what we care about).\n● If using machine learning, understand and avoid data leakage.\n● If asking multiple questions, consider the false discovery rate.\n● If you can, pre-register the study.",

This is an area where spending time with experienced scientists are super useful.\n● You have the experimental skills to run the experiment or the ability to reuse the relevant dataset—or the time to learn.\n● You have the coding/stats skills to decide between the hypotheses using the data—or the time to learn.\n● Ensure you have the right team or the time to learn and acquire the necessary skills. We live in an age where major scientific advances are made by collaborative teams rather than lone \"geniuses.\"\n\nCOLLABORATIONS\n● Science today is a collaborative effort. Ensure you work effectively with others.\n● You need to have a code/data sharing plan to enable replication and extensions of your work.\n● Are you developing code that others can readily use? Because one day, you will be like them - you are effectively collaborating with your future self.\n● Ensure others can check all your experiments and analyses. Science benefits from transparency and error correction. This includes reporting all analyses you did and sharing all data.\n\nTIMELINE\nHow much time will each piece of this project take? Consider potential obstacles.\n● Unrealistic timelines cause scientific projects to fail.\n● Everything usually takes twice as long as expected—budget for that."
