    "context": "IMPORTANT CONTEXT ABOUT RESEARCH APPROACHES:\n\nThere are fundamentally different types of research questions that require different approaches:\n\n1. HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN RESEARCH:\n   - Tests competing explanations about how the world works\n   - Structure: \"Is the world more like A or more like B?\"\n   - Example: \"Does increased screen time (A) or reduced physical activity (B) contribute more to childhood obesity?\"\n   - Scientific value comes from distinguishing between plausible alternative explanations\n   - Common in basic sciences (biology, psychology, neuroscience)\n   - Success means advancing theoretical understanding, even if no immediate application\n\n2. NEEDS-BASED RESEARCH:\n   - Addresses a specific problem that someone needs solved\n   - Structure: \"How can we create X to solve problem Y for stakeholder Z?\"\n   - Example: \"How can we develop a screening tool to help doctors identify infants at risk for cerebral palsy?\"\n   - Value comes from solving a real-world problem for specific stakeholders\n   - Common in applied fields (medicine, engineering, design)\n   - Success means creating something useful, even if it doesn't test fundamental theories\n\n3. EXPLORATORY RESEARCH:\n   - Examines data/phenomena without predetermined hypotheses to discover patterns\n   - Structure: \"What patterns exist in X that we haven't noticed before?\"\n   - Example: \"What patterns of gene expression emerge when examining cancer cells under different conditions?\"\n   - Value comes from discovering unexpected relationships\n   - Used in emerging fields or for complex systems\n   - Success means identifying novel patterns worthy of further investigation",

      "hypothesis": [
        "What are the two competing explanations your research is trying to distinguish between?",
        "How would the world look different if hypothesis A is true versus if hypothesis B is true?",
        "What key evidence would allow you to determine whether hypothesis A or B is more likely correct?",
        "What would be the theoretical significance if your first hypothesis turns out to be supported?",
        "How do your competing hypotheses relate to existing theories in the field?",
        "What prediction does each of your hypotheses make that the other doesn't?",
        "How will you know if neither of your hypotheses adequately explains what you observe?",

        "What are the limitations of existing approaches that make your solution necessary?",
        "How have you validated that this is actually a problem worth solving?",

If the student has written anything at all beyond the template, mark it as \"complete\" - only use \"unstarted\" if the section is empty or unchanged from the template.\n\nAvoid any formatting issues in your JSON. Make sure all strings use proper escape sequences (\\n for newlines, \\\" for quotes) and the array is valid JSON that can be parsed directly.\n\nWhen analyzing sections, determine which research approach they're using (hypothesis-driven, needs-based, or exploratory) and tailor your feedback accordingly.\n\n{{approachGuidance}}"
