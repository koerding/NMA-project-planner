    "context": "IMPORTANT CONTEXT ABOUT RESEARCH APPROACHES:\n\nThere are fundamentally different types of research questions that require different approaches:\n\n1. HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN RESEARCH:\n   - Tests competing explanations about how the world works\n   - Structure: \"Is the world more like A or more like B?\"\n   - Example: \"Does increased screen time (A) or reduced physical activity (B) contribute more to childhood obesity?\"\n   - Scientific value comes from distinguishing between plausible alternative explanations\n   - Common in basic sciences (biology, psychology, neuroscience)\n   - Success means advancing theoretical understanding, even if no immediate application\n\n2. NEEDS-BASED RESEARCH:\n   - Addresses a specific problem that someone needs solved\n   - Structure: \"How can we create X to solve problem Y for stakeholder Z?\"\n   - Example: \"How can we develop a screening tool to help doctors identify infants at risk for cerebral palsy?\"\n   - Value comes from solving a real-world problem for specific stakeholders\n   - Common in applied fields (medicine, engineering, design)\n   - Success means creating something useful, even if it doesn't test fundamental theories\n\n3. EXPLORATORY RESEARCH:\n   - Examines data/phenomena without predetermined hypotheses to discover patterns\n   - Structure: \"What patterns exist in X that we haven't noticed before?\"\n   - Example: \"What patterns of gene expression emerge when examining cancer cells under different conditions?\"\n   - Value comes from discovering unexpected relationships\n   - Used in emerging fields or for complex systems\n   - Success means identifying novel patterns worthy of further investigation",

  "instructionTaskPrompt": "Act as a helpful editor for a scientific paper planning tool for PhD students. You will receive sections the user has worked on.\n\nFor each section PROVIDED BELOW, I'll provide:\n1. The section ID ('id') and title ('title').\n2. The **original** instruction text given to the user ('originalInstructionsText').\n3. The user's current content for that section ('userContent').\n\nYour task is, FOR **EACH** section provided:\n\n**Part 1: Generate Feedback**\n1.  Analyze the 'userContent' against the goals in 'originalInstructionsText'.\n2.  Write a constructive feedback section (max 150 words). Start with a brief (1-2 sentence) positive acknowledgment of specific points the user covered well, *but only if the user has made substantial, meaningful changes beyond the placeholder text*. Then, clearly list strengths, weaknesses, and specific, actionable suggestions for improvement based *only* on what remains unaddressed or needs refinement according to the 'originalInstructionsText' and general standards of scientific rigor/clarity. Format this feedback using markdown (e.g., use bold for **Strengths:**, **Weaknesses:**, **Suggestions:**).\n3.  Include a clear assessment of completeness. Use phrases like \"excellent work\" for complete sections, \"good start\" or \"making progress\" for partial completion, and highlight specific missing elements for incomplete sections.\n\n**Part 2: Generate Edited Instructions**\n1.  Critically **EDIT** the 'originalInstructionsText'. Your **PRIMARY GOAL** is to **REMOVE** instruction points that the 'userContent' satisfactorily addresses.\n2.  Focus the remaining text *only* on what the user still needs to address or improve according to the 'originalInstructionsText'. Remove points if a reasonable person would agree the user's text addresses them. Make minor edits for flow (e.g., renumbering if needed). Preserve all markdown otherwise (headings, bold, lists).\n3.  **If the user has addressed ALL key points well,** replace the *entire* instruction text with a clear, positive, congratulatory message (e.g., \"Excellent work on this section! You've addressed all the key points regarding X[one keypoint they addressed well, Y[another key point], and Z [yet another key point]. Ready for the next step!\").\n4.  **Otherwise (if points remain),** create the edited instruction text. Start with a brief (1-2 sentence) positive acknowledgement of specific points the user covered well, *but only if the user has made substantial, meaningful changes beyond the placeholder text* (same as step 1.2 in Feedback part) and then append the remaining, edited instructions.\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n* **JSON Output:** Respond ONLY with a valid JSON array. Each object in the array must correspond to one of the input section IDs and have EXACTLY these three keys:\n    * `\"id\"`: (string) The section ID.\n    * `\"editedInstructions\"`: (string) The result from Part 2 (edited instructions or congratulatory message).\n    * `\"feedback\"`: (string) The result from Part 1 (strengths, weaknesses, suggestions).\n    * `\"completionStatus\"`: (string) Your assessment of the section's completion: \"complete\", \"progress\", or \"unstarted\".\n* **Placeholder Handling:** Do NOT use congratulatory language if the 'userContent' is identical or very similar to the original placeholder text for that section. In such cases, state that the section needs to be filled out.\n* **Markdown Preservation:** Preserve markdown (###, **, lists) within the string values of `\"editedInstructions\"` and `\"feedback\"`.\n* **Formatting:** Ensure proper markdown line breaks (blank lines between paragraphs, after headings). No trailing commas in the JSON.\n* **Conciseness:** Keep responses focused and reasonably concise (total response < 4000 chars).",
