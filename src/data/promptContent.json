For completed items, give positive feedback about what was done well\n4. For incomplete items, suggest specific improvements\n\nReturn a JSON structure with:\n- Section ID\n- Overall feedback for the section\n- Completion status (\"complete\" or \"unstarted\")\n- Subsection evaluations (each with id, isComplete status, and feedback)\n\nIMPORTANT: \n- DO NOT modify the instruction text itself - only provide feedback\n- Be precise in your isComplete assessments - true only if it meets all requirements\n- Keep feedback concise but specific\n- Cross out is handled by the UI based on your isComplete flag"
