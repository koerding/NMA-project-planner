    "question": "Research Question: Can video-based motion tracking and machine learning accurately assess infant risk for cerebral palsy based on the General Movements Assessment?\n\nSignificance/Impact: Provides a low-cost, accessible method for early CP screening, potentially improving outcomes through earlier intervention, especially in low-resource settings",
    "audience": "Target Audience/Community:\n1. Clinicians involved in infant care and CP diagnosis (pediatricians, therapists, neonatologists)\n2. Researchers in medical machine learning, computer vision, and pediatric neurology",
    "needsresearch": "Who needs this research:\nClinicians, healthcare systems, infants at risk of CP, and families\n\nWhy they need it:\nCurrent CP diagnosis often happens too late for optimal intervention. An automated, early screening tool is needed\n\nCurrent approaches and limitations:\nThe standard General Movements Assessment requires trained clinicians and is not universally accessible. Previous automated attempts had limitations like small datasets or lack of generalizability\n\nSuccess criteria:\nHigh predictive accuracy compared to clinician GMA scores, demonstrated generalizability, and methodological rigor (pre-registration, lock-box set)\n\nAdvantages of this approach:\nLow cost, potential for wide accessibility using standard cameras, scalable, and robust performance without needing dataset-specific fine-tuning",

    "existingdata": "Dataset name and source:\nClinical dataset from CHOP site of the US CP Early Detection and Intervention Network REDcap database\n\nOriginal purpose:\nStandard clinical care, including GMA assessment for high-risk infants\n\nPermissions to use data:\nEthics approval obtained via IRB protocols, data restricted to hospital staff\n\nData quality information:\nVideos evaluated by multiple trained clinicians; adjudication process for disagreements; specific exclusion criteria applied\n\nRelevant variables:\nInfant videos (1-2 mins, supine), clinician-assessed GMA score (fidgety movements present/absent), demographic information, age",
    "analysis": "Data Cleaning: Pose estimation filtering (confidence threshold, interpolation for missing frames, rolling median/mean filters)\n\nPrimary Analysis: Automated machine learning binary classifier trained on 38 kinematic features to predict GMA score ('absent fidgety' vs 'present')\n\nHow Analysis Addresses Question: The classifier's performance (AUC-ROC) on predicting the clinician score demonstrates the feasibility of using video analysis for risk assessment",

    "abstract": "Background: Cerebral Palsy (CP) affects movement control. Early detection via the General Movements Assessment (GMA) is crucial but requires trained clinicians. Automated methods are being explored\n\nObjective: To assess if machine learning using video-based motion tracking features can accurately predict clinician-assessed GMA scores in a large, high-risk infant cohort\n\nMethods: Used a large clinical dataset (over 1000 infants) and an open-source pose estimation pipeline to extract kinematic features. Trained an automated machine learning classifier following a pre-registered plan with validation\n\nResults: The machine learning model achieved high predictive accuracy (AUC 0.79) for the clinician-assessed GMA score on a held-out test set\n\nConclusion: Video-based motion tracking with machine learning shows promise as a low-cost tool for CP risk screening, especially in low-resource areas"
