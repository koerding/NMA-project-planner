        "description": "The cornerstone of scientific inquiry is selecting a well-defined question with an appropriate research philosophy. A strong question can drive understanding, foster innovation, and solve real-world problems.\n\nConsider who else might share your interest. Often, a well-crafted question serves as a conceptual model that frames reality in distinct ways.\n\nClarity about question logic and your research philosophy is essential. There are a small number of canonical approaches in neuroscience research:\n\n• HYPOTHESIS TESTING: Does mechanism X explain observation Y? Can I distinguish between competing mechanisms?\n\n• EXPLORATORY: What patterns exist in this dataset? What brain areas are active during this process?\n\n• ENGINEERING/NEEDS-DRIVEN: How can I solve problem X? What intervention achieves outcome Y?\n\nIdentify which philosophy best matches your research goals and make this explicit in your question formulation.",

Explain how this approach aligns with your research goals.\n\nMake sure your question and philosophy are compatible with each other. For instance, a hypothesis-testing approach would require a question that can be answered with competing explanations, while an exploratory approach would be more focused on identifying patterns or relationships."

It thus has a consequential answer—the result will change how you or others approach the field in the future. A detailed question asks if we should prefer one hypothesis over others, which can be decided by data. Ideally, hypotheses should be expressed in precise terms—whether mathematically or through computational models.\n\nWhen formulating your hypotheses, clarify whether they are novel or have been previously tested, and if the latter, emphasize the importance of replication. And make sure they are fully specified with every word clearly defined. They should specify which exact scenarios they apply to. Finally, verify that you can express your hypotheses as a mathematical model or equation that predicts data probabilities—a key step for robust statistical analysis.",

Rigorous experimental design uses practices that minimize the risk of self-deception.\n\n• If you deal with human evaluations, understand the need for blinding, lest you see what you want.\n\n• If you use resources, know how to validate. Otherwise you can not replicate.\n\n• If you ask mechanistic questions, you likely need to perturb, consider potential confounders.\n\n• Ensure you are asking the question in the most direct way possible. Indirect answers are unreliable.\n\n• If performing perturbations to test causality, randomize them or you will be biased.\n\n• Ensure all aspects of the study are reproducible, by making sure you report everything.\n\n• If you use instruments, make sure they are calibrated and validated.\n\n• Have some diversity of analysed samples to be able to speak to internal validity and think through external validity.\n\n• Make sure you have the ethical side, ACUC and IRB covered.",
