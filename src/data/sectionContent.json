        "text": "A strong research question is the foundation of a successful project. It defines the scope, focus, and purpose of your work and guides all decisions from design to analysis. A well-formulated question ensures clarity, relevance, and feasibility.\n\n---\n\n* **Question Clarity**: Make sure the research question is clearly and unambiguously stated. A well-formed question should be understandable on its own. Avoid vague terms unless you define them. Ideally, a peer from your program should know what you're asking just by reading this sentence or two.\n\n* **Motivation and Importance**: Make sure to clearly explain why this question matters, to you and to the field. This part is just as important as the question itself. Why care? What is exciting about it? Make sure the scientific stake is clear: What changes if we know the answer? Why would others in the field care? What problem, gap, or idea does it speak to?\n\n* **Specificity and Scope**: The question should be focused enough to be answered within the scope of your project. If the question feels like it could lead to ten dissertations, it needs to be narrowed. Aim for a piece of the puzzle that is tractable but still meaningful.\n\n* **Type of Question**: Is it clear whether the question is descriptive (what), mechanistic (how), or explanatory/causal (why)? You don't have to use these exact terms, but you should know what kind of answer you're aiming for — and make sure your framing supports it."

      "inputPlaceholder": "Start writing your hypotheses here...",
      "instructions": {
        "title": "Hypothesis-driven Research",
        "text": "Hypotheses translate your research question into specific, testable ideas. They clarify what you're trying to discover or differentiate and provide structure for your experimental or analytical design. Clear hypotheses improve transparency and strengthen the logic of your work. \p\p **Alignment With Your Question: Hypotheses should directly reflect and address your research question.** Make sure your hypotheses flow logically from your Research Question. They must be plausible answers to that question, not independent ideas. *Strong hypotheses are rooted in the overarching research question, translating it into testable predictions. This close alignment avoids scattered or unrelated explorations that fail to advance your core inquiry. When hypotheses naturally grow out of your question, you create a clean line of reasoning that helps you design effective experiments and analyses. Reviewers often check for this consistency as a marker of well-structured research. Moreover, the process of deriving hypotheses from the question forces you to articulate what, specifically, you expect to learn—paving the way for more robust and conclusive interpretations.* \p\p **Formulate 2+ Distinct Hypotheses:Each hypothesis should be specific and testable.** If possible, propose multiple hypotheses that differ in real ways. Avoid vague generalities. *Having more than one clear, testable hypothesis demonstrates that you’ve considered multiple outcomes or explanations. This approach strengthens your research design by revealing possible twists or turns in the data. Instead of betting on a single result, you’re genuinely probing the phenomenon from multiple angles, which is the essence of scientific rigor. Distinct hypotheses also sharpen your analytical plan, ensuring you collect and interpret data that can differentiate among them. If each hypothesis is well-defined, readers can see exactly how you’ll measure success or failure for each scenario, enhancing the study’s transparency and credibility.* **Ability to Differentiate: Your study must allow you to tell these hypotheses apart.** If your data can't actually differentiate your hypotheses, you need to revise them or rethink your design. *Proposing multiple hypotheses only matters if your methods and data can separate one possibility from another. It’s crucial to identify the metrics, experimental conditions, or statistical thresholds that would support one hypothesis while undermining the others. This clarity of measurement and analysis is foundational for meaningful findings. Without it, you risk ambiguous interpretations or arguments that “any result fits.” Planning in advance for how you’ll distinguish among hypotheses shows that you’re serious about testing alternative ideas. It also keeps your study from falling into the trap of confirming a single perspective simply because the design wasn’t set up to refute it.* \p\p **Scientific Importance:Explain why distinguishing between these hypotheses matters to science and to you.** What do we learn if hypothesis A is right? What if B is? Why do you care? Why should others? *Hypotheses are most valuable when each potential outcome tells a different and meaningful story. By articulating the importance of each hypothetical result, you demonstrate the intellectual merit of your project. Whether the finding supports one hypothesis or another, the field stands to learn something tangible. This significance can range from resolving a debated mechanism to illuminating an entirely novel phenomenon. For your own motivation, framing the hypotheses’ importance also keeps you engaged—knowing that your work might clarify core issues in the literature or inspire new lines of inquiry. Such framing is often persuasive for funding bodies and conference audiences too.* \p\p ** Data and Decision: Show how results will help you decide between hypotheses.** Reference how your analysis plan will reveal support for one hypothesis over another. *Before you collect data, specify how you will interpret potential outcomes in the context of your hypotheses. Are you looking for significant differences in a key variable? Do you expect certain correlations to hold true only under one hypothesis? By tying each anticipated pattern to a particular hypothesis, you streamline your analysis. This approach also promotes transparency: readers can see upfront that you’re not cherry-picking findings later. When you connect data expectations to a specific decision rule—like a p-value cutoff, a Bayesian odds ratio, or a predicted effect size—it’s easier for others to gauge the strength of your conclusions.* \p\p **Avoid HARKing: Don’t write your hypotheses after seeing results.** If you find something new post hoc, label it exploratory. Don’t revise history. *HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) dilutes scientific integrity and confuses the narrative of how findings emerged. While it’s natural to refine your thinking once you see unexpected data, ethical practice dictates you label that shift as exploratory or post hoc. This honesty fosters clearer research records and helps avoid misleading others about the nature of your inquiry. It also paves the way for follow-up studies that formally test new ideas. By upfront labeling and avoiding retroactive hypothesis creation, you preserve trust in your results and maintain the standard of rigorous, transparent science.*"
