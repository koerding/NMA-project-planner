      "content": "Write out the skills you will need and the collaborations you may need to cover skills you do not currently have. Make a timeline of how long each task in the pipeline will take you. (5 minutes max).\n\nSKILLS\n\n• You have the conceptual understanding to choose a good question of the chosen complexity—or the time to learn. This is an area where spending time with experienced scientists are super useful.\n\n• You have the experimental skills to run the experiment or the ability to reuse the relevant dataset—or the time to learn.\n\n• You have the coding/stats skills to decide between the hypotheses using the data—or the time to learn.\n\n• Ensure you have the right team or the time to learn and acquire the necessary skills. We live in an age where major scientific advances are made by collaborative teams rather than lone \"geniuses.\"\n\nCOLLABORATIONS\n\n• Science today is a collaborative effort. Ensure you work effectively with others.\n\n• You need to have a code/data sharing plan to enable replication and extensions of your work.\n\n• Are you developing code that others can readily use? Because one day, you will be like them - you are effectively collaborating with your future self.\n\n• Ensure others can check all your experiments and analyses. Science benefits from transparency and error correction. This includes reporting all analyses you did and sharing all data.\n\nTIMELINE\nHow much time will each piece of this project take? Consider potential obstacles.\n\n• Unrealistic timelines cause scientific projects to fail.\n\n• Everything usually takes twice as long as expected—budget for that."
