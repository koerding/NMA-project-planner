    "description": "To check if everything logically fits together, write an abstract. It should have the following structure, with each component being 1-2 sentences.\n\n• The field and the intuitive hypothesis—why it matters.\n\n• The methods used (e.g., \"Here, we test the hypothesis using…\").\n\n• The results (even if speculative)—how they distinguish between hypotheses.\n\n• The implications for the field.",

  "llmInstructions": "I want you to check the resulting abstract. Does it fit the requested format? Does it feel convincing? Is it well written? Is the language clear? What changes would make it more powerful? Be super constructive. Try to communicate in a modern Socrates dialogue way, helpful, clear, enthusiastic. Go a bit with the user through what they learned as part of this exercise. What will they do better next time?"
