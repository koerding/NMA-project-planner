    "description": "Another important aspect of science is how we get the data we need to answer the question. How can we make sure the data is of high quality? How can we avoid biases? How can we make sure the hypotheses are cleanly tested? Do you have preliminary data for planning?\n\nSome overarching ideas to generate strong experiments:\n\n• Sketch how the experiment will convincingly produce the right data.\n\n• Ensure you are not conducting the experiment simply because it is feasible in your lab.\n\n• If possible, simulate experiments first.\n\n• Ask yourself which other questions can be answered with the dataset.\n\nThere are many methods that might inadvertently favor a preferred hypothesis. Rigorous experimental design uses practices that minimize the risk of self-deception.\n\n• If you deal with human evaluations, understand the need for blinding, lest you see what you want.\n\n• If you use resources, know how to validate. Otherwise you can not replicate.\n\n• If you ask mechanistic questions, you likely need to perturb, consider potential confounders.\n\n• Ensure you are asking the question in the most direct way possible. Indirect answers are unreliable.\n\n• If performing perturbations to test causality, randomize them or you will be biased.\n\n• Ensure all aspects of the study are reproducible, by making sure you report everything.\n\n• If you use instruments, make sure they are calibrated and validated.\n\n• Have some diversity of analysed samples to be able to speak to internal validity and think through external validity.\n\n• Make sure you have the ethical side, ACUC and IRB covered.",

      "content": "Write out how you plan to run the experiment. You may also have to revisit this as you go through this design work. It is ok if it starts out being suboptimal. Just write your best idea for the experiment you want to use to distinguish the hypotheses. This will have to include stimulus protocols, apparatus, sample size, recruitment strategy, all the things that are meaningfully part of your experimental design.\n\nAlso, write down exactly how the distinct hypotheses will predict measurements that will be distinct. A lot of experiments are designed in such a way that the data does not really distinguish between the hypotheses."

  "llmInstructions": "Only work on experimental design step. See the instructions above and guide the user interactively towards designing a good experiment given questions and hypotheses. Consider that question and hypotheses may also require revision. Use Socrates method where possible. I want you to guide the discussion to the following topics: I want you to check if the experiment tests the hypotheses set up above. I want you to check if it does so as directly as possible. Lastly, I want to go through the above mentioned potential rigor problems and help the user make sure they do not violate any of them. Focus on the ones that matter for their design. Feel free to interactively refine this with the user. I want you to be super constructive and make proposals to improve the experimental design."
