    "description": "A third aspect of science is how we convert the data into a concrete preference for one hypothesis. How can we make sure the data is used in an unbiased way? How can we know how uncertain we are? How can we make sure we are not fooling ourselves in the data analysis?\n\nSome Ideas to generate strong data analysis plans:\n\n• Consider validating your analysis approach on simulated or pilot data to ensure reliability.\n\n• Write down what you extract from the data and how each hypothesis expects different extractions.\n\n• Implement hypotheses mathematically so they assign compatibility between hypothesis and data (taking care of free parameters).\n\n• Pre-register your data analysis plan and maintain a detailed log of any deviations from the original protocol to ensure complete transparency and minimize bias.\n\nAVOID THE DATA ANALYSIS RIGOR TRAPS\nThere are so many ways how we our data analysis pipeline can favor a hypothesis we like. The key about doing rigorous data analysis is to use practices that minimize the probability of misleading ourselves.\n\n• Use the most direct data analysis strategy to answer your question to avoid misleading answers.\n\n• Know what outcome switching is and have a plan to avoid it.\n\n• Be aware of statistical power and plan your study large enough.\n\n• Be aware of human biases (such as conflict of interest) and have a plan to avoid them.\n\n• Store and handle data in a replicable and shareable manner.\n\n• Use a good quantification metric (one that approximates what we care about).\n\n• If using machine learning, understand and avoid data leakage.\n\n• If asking multiple questions, consider the false discovery rate.\n\n• If you can, pre-register the study.",

      "content": "Write out how you plan to analyze the expected data. The key is that the input are the data as measured. You will then probably want to do some sanity checks. Then this will cumulate in an analysis that assigns probabilities to hypotheses. Write out how you will quantify uncertainty (say p-values). Also consider how you will handle free parameters that you may need to fit."

  "llmInstructions": "I want you to check if the data analysis pipeline cleanly tests the hypotheses set up above based on the experiment described above. I want you to check if it does so as directly and cleanly as possible. Lastly, I want to go through the above mentioned potential rigor problems and help the user make sure they do not violate any of them. Focus on the ones that matter for their design. Feel free to interactively refine this with the user. I want you to be super constructive and make proposals to improve the data analysis design."
