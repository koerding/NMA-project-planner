    "title": "A WELL-SPECIFIED QUESTION WITH CLEAR RESEARCH PHILOSOPHY",
    "description": "The cornerstone of scientific inquiry is selecting a well-defined question with an appropriate research philosophy. A strong question can drive understanding, foster innovation, and solve real-world problems.\n\nConsider who else might share your interest. Often, a well-crafted question serves as a conceptual model that frames reality in distinct ways.\n\nClarity about question logic and your research philosophy is essential. There are a small number of canonical approaches in neuroscience research:\n\n• HYPOTHESIS TESTING: Does mechanism X explain observation Y? Can I distinguish between competing mechanisms?\n\n• EXPLORATORY: What patterns exist in this dataset? What brain areas are active during this process?\n\n• ENGINEERING/NEEDS-DRIVEN: How can I solve problem X? What intervention achieves outcome Y?\n\nIdentify which philosophy best matches your research goals and make this explicit in your question formulation.",

      "title": "Drafting Your Question and Philosophy",
      "content": "Draft your research question and identify your research philosophy. Spend about 10 minutes on your initial version and plan to refine it as you gain new insights.\n\nFor your question: Be clear about what you want to study and why it matters to you (objectives). Make a list of scientists who will also care about the question.\n\nFor your philosophy: Explicitly state whether you're doing hypothesis testing, exploratory research, or needs-driven research. Explain how this approach aligns with your research goals.\n\nMake sure your question and philosophy are compatible with each other. For instance, a hypothesis-testing approach would require a question that can be answered with competing explanations, while an exploratory approach would be more focused on identifying patterns or relationships."

I want you to check if the question feels like a good question for scientific inquiry and if the research philosophy aligns well with the question. Please evaluate:\n\n1. Strengths and weaknesses of the question\n2. Whether the research philosophy (hypothesis testing, exploratory, or needs-driven) is appropriate for the question\n3. How well the question matches my stated objectives\n4. Whether the listed scientists would truly find this question interesting\n\nPlease also suggest 3-5 additional professors or researchers who might be especially interested in this topic. If my research philosophy isn't explicit or doesn't align with my question, help me refine both to create a coherent research approach."
